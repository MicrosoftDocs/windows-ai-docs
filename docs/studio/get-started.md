# Get started with Windows AI Studio

Windows AI Studio simplifies generative AI app development by bringing together cutting-edge AI development tools and models from the Azure AI Studio catalog and other catalogs like Hugging Face. You can browse the AI models catalog powered by Azure ML and Hugging Face, download them locally, fine-tune, test, and use them in your Windows application. All of the computation happens locally, so please check whether your device meets the hardware requirements.

In this article, you'll learn how to install and configure Windows AI Studio so you're ready to fine tune, test, and use AI models on Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
