# Tutorial: Create a Windows Machine Learning Desktop application (Python)

With Windows Machine Learning, you can create a Windows 10 desktop application in Python, and run evaluations with ONNX models locally on the device. The Python/WinRT projection allows you to use Windows Runtime APIs (including WinML) in a language you're already familiar with.

See [Tutorial: Create a Windows Machine Learning application with Python/WinRT](https://github.com/Microsoft/xlang/tree/master/samples/python/winml_tutorial) to see how to create a simple WinML application in Python. This tutorial corresponds to [Tutorial: Create a Windows Machine Learning Desktop application (C++)](get-started-desktop.md), focusing on the differences between the two.
