# Automatic code generation with mlgen

Windows Machine Learning's code generator **mlgen** creates an interface (C#, [C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/), and C++/CX) with wrapper classes that call the [Windows ML API](/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning) for you, allowing you to easily load, bind, and evaluate a model in your project.

## Getting the tool

**mlgen** is provided as a [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) extension for developers creating WinML applications in VS 2017 or later.

In Windows 10, version 1903 and later, **mlgen** is no longer included in the Windows 10 SDK, so you must download and install the extension. There is one for [Visual Studio 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WinML.mlgen) and one for [Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WinML.mlgenv2).

## Using mglen

Once you have **mlgen** installed, inside your Visual Studio project, add your ONNX file to your projectâ€™s **Assets** folder, and VS will generate Windows ML wrapper classes in a new interface file. You can use these classes and methods to integrate your model into your application.
