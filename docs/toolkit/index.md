# AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code overview

> [!NOTE]
> The AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) was previously known as Windows AI Studio. The extension has been renamed to reflect the focus on enabling AI development in VS Code across platforms.

The AI Toolkit for VS Code (AI Toolkit) is a VS Code extension that enables you to:

- Download and run AI models locally. The AI Toolkit provides out-of-the-box access to highly optimized models for the following platforms and hardware:
  - Windows 11 running with DirectML acceleration
  - Windows 11 running directly on the CPU
  - Linux with NVIDIA acceleration
  - Linux running directly on the CPU
- Test models in an intuitive playground or in your application with a REST API.
- Fine-tune your AI model - locally or in the cloud (on a virtual machine) - to create new skills, improve reliability of responses, set the tone and format of the response. The AI Toolkit provides a guided walkthrough to fine-tune popular small-language models (SLMs) - like [Phi-3](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-phi-3-redefining-whats-possible-with-slms/) and [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/).
- Deploy your AI feature either to the cloud or with an application that runs on a device.
