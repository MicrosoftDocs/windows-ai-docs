# What is the AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code?

The AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a VS Code extension that simplifies generative AI app development by bringing together cutting-edge AI development tools and models from [Azure AI Studio Catalog](/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview) and other catalogs like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models).

## AI Toolkit features

The AI Toolkit for VS Code (AI Toolkit) enables you to:

- Download and run AI models locally. The AI Toolkit provides access to highly optimized models for the following platforms and hardware:
  - Windows 11 running with DirectML acceleration
  - Windows 11 running directly on the CPU
  - Linux with NVIDIA acceleration
  - Linux running directly on the CPU
  - *MacOS support is coming soon*
- Test models in an intuitive playground or in your application with a REST API.
- Fine-tune your AI model - locally or in the cloud (on a virtual machine) - to create new skills, improve reliability of responses, set the tone and format of the response. The AI Toolkit provides a guided walkthrough to fine-tune popular small-language models (SLMs) - like [Phi-3](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-phi-3-redefining-whats-possible-with-slms/) and [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/).
- Deploy your AI feature either to the cloud or with an application that runs on a device.

> [!NOTE]
> The AI Toolkit was previously known as Windows AI Studio. The extension has been renamed to reflect the focus on enabling AI development in VS Code across platforms.
