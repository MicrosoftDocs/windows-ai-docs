# AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code overview

The AI Toolkit for VS Code (AI Toolkit) is a VS Code extension that enables you to:

- Download and run AI models locally. The AI Toolkit provides out-of-the-box access to highly optimized models for your platform/hardware:
  - Windows/DirectML
  - Windows/CPU
  - Linux/Nvidia
  - Linux/CPU
- Test models in an intuitive playground or in your application with a REST API.
- Fine-tune your AI model - locally or in the cloud (on a virtual machine) - to create new skills, improve reliability of responses, set tone/format of response. The AI Toolkit provides a guided walkthrough to fine-tune popular small-language models (SLMs) - like [Phi-3](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-phi-3-redefining-whats-possible-with-slms/) and [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/).
- Deploy your AI feature either to the cloud or with an application that runs on a device.
