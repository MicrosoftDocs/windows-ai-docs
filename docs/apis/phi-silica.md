# Get started using the Phi Silica API

TODO: Introduction

## What is Phi Silica?

Phi Silica is an API surface that is part of the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/). Designed for Windows devices with a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), Phi Silica enables on-device tasks using a local Machine Learning (ML) model for text generation and conversation features that require privacy, as the data does not leave the device.

Similar to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Large Language Model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT, Phi is a Small Language Model (SLM) developed by Microsoft Research to perform language-processing tasks on a local device. This has benefits for latency and cost, as there are no calls to a cloud provider.

## Prerequisites

    - Cadmus device?
    - WinAppSDK version?
    - Windows version?
    - Others?

## How to download Phi Silica

Phi Silica is an optional download for developers that needs to be downloaded to use (TODO steps?). It follows the WinAppSDK 1.6 release, meaning developers can build and test apps with the May 2024 experimental release (TODO link?) but can only publish to the Store with the August GA release (TODO link?).

The API will be ready out-of-box for new devices in June (TODO device name, link?), but not yet for other 3rd party devices that may be launching with an NPU.
