# Enable PyTorch with DirectML on Windows

This preview provides a DirectML packend for PyTorch by using the **torch-directml** package. Once set up, you can start with our [samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/PyTorch) or use the Ai Toolkit for VSCode

> [!NOTE]
> **Some information relates to pre-released product, which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.**

## Check your version of Windows 

The **torch-directml** package on native Windows works starting with Windows 10, version 1709 (Build 16299 or higher). You can check your build version number by running `winver` via the **Run** command (Windows logo key + R).

## Check for GPU driver updates

Ensure that you have the latest GPU driver installed. Select **Check for updates** in the **Windows Update** section of the **Settings** app.

## Set up the Torch-DirectML Plugin Preview 

We recommend setting up a virtual Python environment inside Windows. There are many tools that you can use to set up a virtual Python environment&mdash;for these instructions, we'll useâ€¯[Anaconda's Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). The rest of this setup assumes that you use a Miniconda environment. 

### Set up a Python environment 

Download and install the [Miniconda Windows installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers) on your system. There's [additional guidance for setup](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html) on Anaconda's site. Once Miniconda is installed, create an environment using Python named **directml**, and activate it through the following commands.

```
conda create --name pydml -y
conda activate pydml
```

### Install PyTorch and the Torch-DirectML Plugin 

> [!NOTE]
> The torch-directml package supports up to PyTorch 2.2

The latest release of Torch-DirectML follows a plugin model, meaning you have two packages to install. First, install the PyTorch dependencies by running the following commands:

```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

Next, install the Torch-DirectML plugin.

```
pip install torch-directml
```

### Verification and Device Creation

Once you've installed the Torch-DirectML package, you can verify that it runs correctly by adding two tensors. First start an interactive Python session, and import Torch with the following lines:

```
import torch
import torch_directml
dml = torch_directml.device()
```
The current release of the Torch-DirectML plugin is mapped to the "PrivateUse1" Torch backend. The new torch_directml.device() API is a convenient wrapper for sending your tensors to the DirectML device.

With the DirectML device created, you can now define two simple tensors; one tensor containing a 1 and another containing a 2. Place the tensors on the "dml" device.

```
tensor1 = torch.tensor([1]).to(dml) # Note that dml is a variable, not a string!
tensor2 = torch.tensor([2]).to(dml)
```

Add the tensors together, and print the results.

```
dml_algebra = tensor1 + tensor2
dml_algebra.item()
```

You should see the number 3 being output, as in the example below.

```
>>> import torch
>>> tensor1 = torch.tensor([1]).to(dml)
>>> tensor2 = torch.tensor([2]).to(dml)
>>> dml_algebra = tensor1 + tensor2
>>> dml_algebra.item()
3
```
