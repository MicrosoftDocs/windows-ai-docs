# DML_ACTIVATION_SWISH_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Performs a swish activation function on every element in *InputTensor*, placing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

```
f(x) = x * Sigmoid(SigmoidInputScale * x)
```

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that the output tensor is permitted to alias *InputTensor* during binding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/) version 1.13 and later. Also see [DirectML version history](../dml-version-history.md).

## Syntax

```cpp
struct DML_ACTIVATION_SWISH_OPERATOR_DESC
{
    const DML_TENSOR_DESC* InputTensor;
    const DML_TENSOR_DESC* OutputTensor;
    FLOAT SigmoidInputScale;
};
```

## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

`SigmoidInputScale`

Type: [**FLOAT**](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)

The constant coefficient. A typical default for this value is 1.0.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in **DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_6_2**.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
