# Enable GPU acceleration for TensorFlow 2 with tensorflow-directml-plugin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is now discontinued, and isn't actively being worked on.

This release provides students, beginners, and professionals a way to run machine learning (ML) training on their existing DirectX 12-enabled hardware by using the DirectML Plugin for TensorFlow 2. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can install `tensorflow-directml-plugin` by using Python x86-64 3.10. But `tensorflow-directml-plugin` isn't supported for version 3.11 and later.

Learn how to configure your device to run and train models with the GPU using `tensorflow-directml-plugin`.

## STEP 1: Minimum (and maximum) system requirements
Before installing the TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin, ensure your version of Windows or WSL supports TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin.

### Windows native

* Windows 10 Version 1709, 64-bit (Build 16299 or higher) or Windows 11 Version 21H2, 64-bit (Build 22000 or higher)
* Python x86-64 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10. Version 3.10 is also the *maximum* supported version.
* One of the following supported GPUs:
  * AMD Radeon R5/R7/R9 2xx series or newer
  * Intel HD Graphics 5xx or newer
  * NVIDIA GeForce GTX 9xx series GPU or newer

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

* Windows 10 Version 21H2, 64-bit (Build 20150 or higher) or Windows 11 Version 21H2, 64-bit (Build 22000 or higher)
* Python x86-64 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10. Version 3.10 is also the *maximum* supported version.
* One of the following supported GPUs:
  * AMD Radeon R5/R7/R9 2xx series or newer, and [20.20.01.05 driver or newer](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
  * Intel HD Graphics 6xx or newer, and [28.20.100.8322 driver or newer](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19344/intel-graphics-windows-dch-drivers.html)
  * NVIDIA GeForce GTX 9xx series GPU or newer, and [460.20 driver or newer](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)

## Install the latest GPU driver
Ensure that you have the latest GPU driver installed for your hardware. Select **Check for updates** in the **Windows Update** section of the **Settings** app. If needed, pick up an install from your hardware vendor using the above links.

## STEP 2: Configure your Windows environment

### Windows native
The **TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin** package on native Windows works starting with Windows 10, version 1709 (Build 16299 or higher). You can check your build version number by running `winver` via the **Run** command (Windows logo key + R).

### Windows Subsystem for Linux
Once you've installed the above driver, ensure you [enable WSL](/windows/wsl/install-win10) and [install a glibc-based distribution](/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice) (such as Ubuntu or Debian). For our testing, we used Ubuntu. Ensure you have the latest kernel by selecting **Check for updates** in the **Windows Update** section of the Settings app. 

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you have the **Receive updates for other Microsoft products when you update Windows** option enabled. You can find it in **Advanced options** within the **Windows Update** section of the Settings app. 

For these features, you need a kernel version of 5.10.43.3 or higher. You can check the version number by running the following command in PowerShell. 

```
wsl cat /proc/version
```

## STEP 3: Set up your environment

We recommend setting up a virtual Python environment inside Windows. There are many tools that you can use to set up a virtual Python environment&mdash;for these instructions, we'll use [Anaconda's Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). The rest of this setup assumes that you use a Miniconda environment. [Learn more about using python environments](https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-104c62d48c54)

### Create an environment in Miniconda

Download and install the [Miniconda Windows installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers) on your system. There is [additional guidance for setup](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html) on Anaconda's site. Once Miniconda is installed, create an environment using Python named **tfdml_plugin**, and activate it through the following commands.

```
conda create --name tfdml_plugin python=3.9 

conda activate tfdml_plugin 
```

> [!NOTE]
> tensorflow version >= 2.9 and python version >= 3.7 supported.

## STEP 4: Install base TensorFlow
Download the base TensorFlow package. Currently the directml-plugin only works with `tensorflowâ€“cpu==2.10` and not `tensorflow` or `tensorflow-gpu`.

```
pip install tensorflow-cpu==2.10
```

## STEP 5: Install tensorflow-directml-plugin
Installing this package automatically enables the DirectML backend for existing scripts without any code changes.

```
pip install tensorflow-directml-plugin
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your training scripts hardcode the device string to something other than `"GPU"`, that might throw errors.

Alternatively, the package can be built from the source. [Instructions for building `tensorflow-directml-plugin` from source](https://github.com/microsoft/tensorflow-directml-plugin/blob/main/BUILD.md).
