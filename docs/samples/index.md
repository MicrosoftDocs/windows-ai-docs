# AI on Windows Sample Gallery

Enhance your Windows apps with AI through local APIs and Machine Learning models.

## AI-powered Audio Editor

**GitHub Repo**: [AI Audio Editor Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Audio-Editor)

**Description**: The AI-powered Audio Editor demonstrates building a WinUI 3 audio editing app which utilizes AI to match snips of audio to a relevant query. An example use-case could be a podcast creator who wants to create short audio clips of their content to promote on Social Media. The sample uses local ML model inference to handle transcription and semantic search.

**Features**: Local Model Inferencing with ONNX Runtime, Whisper model, Embeddings model

**App Type**: [C#](/dotnet/csharp/), [WinUI 3](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/)

## AI-powered notes application

![Screenshot of AI-assisted Notes Sample App showing an AI created summary.](../images/sample-ainotes-app.png)

**GitHub Repo**: [AI-powered Notes Sample App](https://aka.ms/real-ai-demo)

**Description**:  This AI-powered note taking application demonstrates the use of APIs including [OCR Text Recognition](../apis/text-recognition.md), Audio Transcription through local ML model, Semantic Search through a local embeddings model, local language model usage with Phi3 for summarization, autocomplete, and text reasoning, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounding language models to real data.

**Features**: Semantic search with local model, Audio transcription with local model, Local Retreval Augmented generation (RAG) with [Phi3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx), Local Text summarization and reasoning with Phi3, Text extraction from images with [OCR API](../apis/text-recognition.md)

**App Type**: [C#](/dotnet/csharp/), [WinUI 3](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/)

## Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) with PDFs using Phi3 in a WPF sample app

![Screenshot description.](../images/sample-rag-pdf-analyzer-wpf.png)

**GitHub Repo**: [RAG PDF Analyzer WPF Sample App](https://github.com/microsoft/RAG-PDF-Analyzer-WPF-Sample/)

**Description**: This WPF sample app demonstrates how to build an experience with a local language model (such as Phi3) to answer questions about content in a PDF document. The sample finds answers by referencing a knowledge base outside of the model's own training data before generating a response. This pattern, called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), is an example of how to ground a language model to real-world authoritative data.

**Features**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), ONNX Runtime Generative AI, DirectML

**App Type**: [C#](/dotnet/csharp/), [WPF](/dotnet/desktop/wpf/)

## Phi3 Generative AI Chat Sample WinUI 3 App

![Screenshot description.](../images/sample-phi3-chat.png)

**GitHub Repo**: [Phi3 Chat WinUI 3 Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Phi3-Chat-WinUI3-Sample)

**Description**: This WinUI 3 app sample demonstrates how to use the ONNX Runtime Generative AI library to build a chat experience with a local language model, specifically the Phi3 Small Language Model (SLM).

**Features**: [Phi3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx), [ONNX Runtime Generative AI](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/genai/howto/install.html), [DirectML](../directml/dml.md)

**App Type**: [C#](/dotnet/csharp/), [WinUI 3](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/)

## Hardware acceleration samples

### Hardware accelerated Stable Diffusion on the web

![Screenshot description.](../images/sample-webnn-stablediffusion.png)

**GitHub Repo**: [WebNN
Stable Diffusion Turbo](https://microsoft.github.io/webnn-developer-preview/demos/sd-turbo/)

**Description**: This sample illustrates how to use WebNN with ONNX Runtime web to run Stable Diffusion locally on the GPU with DirectML. [SD-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/onnxruntime-web-temp/demo/tree/main/sd-turbo) is a fast generative text-to-image model that can synthesize photorealistic images from a text prompt in a single network evaluation. In the demo, you can generate an image in 2s on AI PC devices by leveraging WebNN API, a dedicated low-level API for neural network inference hardware acceleration.

**Features**: Local Image Generation, [WebNN](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/), [DirectML](../directml/dml.md)

**App Type**: [JavaScript](/windows/dev-environment/javascript/), Web apps

### Hardware accelerated Segment Anything on the web

**GitHub Repo**: [WebNN
Segment Anything](https://microsoft.github.io/webnn-developer-preview/demos/segment-anything/)

**Description**: This sample illustrates how to use WebNN with ONNX Runtime web to run Segment Anything locally on the GPU with DirectML. [Segment Anything](https://huggingface.co/onnxruntime-web-temp/demo/tree/main/segment-anything) is a new AI model from Meta AI that can "cut out" any object. In the demo, you can segment any object from your uploaded images.

**Features**: Local Image Segmentation, [WebNN](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/), [DirectML](../directml/dml.md)

**App Type**: [JavaScript](/windows/dev-environment/javascript/), Web apps

### Hardware accelerated Whisper on the web

**GitHub Repo**: [WebNN
Whisper Base](https://microsoft.github.io/webnn-developer-preview/demos/whisper-base/)

**Description**: This sample illustrates how to use WebNN with ONNX Runtime web to run the Whisper modelâ€™s speech-to-text capabilities locally on the GPU or NPU with DirectML. [Whisper Base](https://huggingface.co/onnxruntime-web-temp/demo/tree/main/whisper-base) is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation. In the demo, you can experience the speech to text feature by using on-device inference powered by WebNN API and DirectML, especially the NPU acceleration.
