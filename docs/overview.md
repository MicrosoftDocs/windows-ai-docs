# Windows AI Overview

Learn about the AI features, tools and capabilities available on Windows, including:

- List paths

## Guidance for using AI with Windows

Intro about how great Windows is as an OS for working with AI, locally fine tuning models, supporting apps that utilize AI models, hardware acceleration with GPUs and NPUs, ...cover some high-level concepts, like what is fine-tuning, where to find FAQs covering things like what is ONNX, maybe a section about the value of why it may make sense to work locally vs in the cloud related to privacy, cost, network connection, etc.

- [Optimize your app for Recall](recall.md): TODO description of how Recall uses breadcrumbs for the user to return to a previous place.
- [Apply AI effects to your device camera or microphone](./studio-effects/index.md): Devices with an NPU can utilize optimized AI effects like Background Blur, Eye Contact, Auto Framing, and Voice Focus.
- [Get started using AI-backed APIs in your Windows app](apis.md): TODO description needed. AI-backed APIs that are currently available include: [Phi2 Silica](phi2silica.md) and [OCR (Optical Character Recognition)](ocr.md).
- [Get started using local Machine Learning models in your Windows app](models.md): Work directly with Machine Learning (ML) models, training or fine-tuning the model with your own custom data tailored to your needs, and running it locally in your app to preserve privacy, reduce latency, and save on cloud costs.
- [Find AI code samples for Windows apps](./samples/index.md): TODO description needed.
- [Find guidance for Responsible AI practices with Windows](rai.md): Resources and guidance to assist you in working with AI on Windows and incorporating AI responsibly into your Windows apps.
