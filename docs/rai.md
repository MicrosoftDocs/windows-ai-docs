# Responsible AI in Windows

At Microsoft, we take our commitment to responsible AI seriously. We have gathered resources and guidance to assist you in working with AI on Windows and incorporating AI responsibly into your Windows apps.

Microsoft has developed a Responsible AI Standard, including six principles that should guide AI development and use: 

- **Fairness**: AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- **Reliability and safety**: AI systems should perform reliably and safely.
- **Privacy and security**: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy.
- **Inclusiveness**: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.
- **Transparency**: AI systems should be understandable.
- **Accountability**: People should be accountable for AI systems.

## Incorporating AI into your Windows app

Many organizations have published principles to guide the responsible development and deployment of AI systems, but as a developer or publisher of a Windows application, you are responsible for putting these principles into practice when incorporating AI-backed APIs or Machine Learning models into your app.

Microsoft has developed an [AI Fairness Checklist](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/ai-fairness-checklist/#overview) to help you.

Additionally, Microsoft has developed [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction - Best practices for designing AI user experiences](https://www.microsoft.com/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/). These evidence-based best practices for designing your AI user experiences include links to HAX Design Library, with examples and design patterns for implementing each of the 18 guidelines, a HAX Workbook to help you prioritize guidelines to apply and how to implement them, and the opportunity to submit ideas for new patterns and examples.

## Responsible AI Toolbox

Responsible AI is an approach to assessing, developing, and deploying AI systems in a safe, trustworthy and ethical manner. The [Responsible AI toolbox](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox) is a suite of tools providing a collection of model and data exploration and assessment user interfaces and libraries that enable a better understanding of AI systems. These interfaces and libraries empower developers and stakeholders of AI systems to develop and monitor AI more responsibly, and take better data-driven actions.

In addition, learn how the [Responsible AI Dashboard Model Debugging](https://responsibleaitoolbox.ai/introducing-responsible-ai-dashboard/) can help you to Identify, Diagnose, and Mitigate issues, using data to take informed actions.This customizable experience can be taken in a multitude of directions, from analyzing the model or data holistically, to conducting a deep dive or comparison on cohorts of interest, to explaining and perturbing model predictions for individual instances, and to informing users on business decisions and actions.
